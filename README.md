# NextGenTorch

NextGenTorch is a powerful and flexible PyTorch-based library for next-generation language models, designed to accelerate research and development in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

## Features

- State-of-the-art language model architectures
- Efficient training and inference on large-scale datasets
- Seamless integration with popular datasets and APIs
- Advanced generative AI capabilities
- Customizable model configurations
- Distributed training support

## Installation

Install NextGenTorch and its dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install nextgentorch torch pytest fairscale langchain transformers
```

## Quick Start

```python
from nextgentorch import NextGenTorchModel, ChatInterface

# Load a pre-trained model
model = NextGenTorchModel.from_pretrained("nextgentorch/base")

# Generate text
chat = ChatInterface(model=model)
response = chat.generate("Tell me about artificial intelligence.", max_length=100)
print(response)
```

## Usage with Datasets

NextGenTorch supports seamless integration with datasets from various sources, including Hugging Face, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

### Hugging Face Datasets

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from nextgentorch import NextGenTorchModel

# Load a dataset
dataset = load_dataset("wikipedia", "20220301.en")

# Create a NextGenTorch model
model = NextGenTorchModel.from_pretrained("nextgentorch/base")

# Fine-tune the model on the dataset
model.train(dataset["train"])

# Generate text using the fine-tuned model
output = model.generate("Artificial intelligence is")
print(output)
```

For datasets from Google, Meta, and Microsoft, please refer to their respective APIs and documentation.

## Advanced Features

1. **Temperature Control**: Adjust creativity with `temperature` parameter.
2. **Top-k Sampling**: Control diversity using `top_k` parameter.
3. **Beam Search**: Improve quality with `num_beams` parameter.
4. **Extended Context**: Handle up to 8192 tokens of context.

Example:
```python
response = chat.generate(
    "Explain quantum computing",
    max_length=200,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_k=50,
    num_beams=5
)
```
